There have been great changes in the life surroundings and the conditions of human beings during the past century.
 Less than a hundred years ago many of the things that we do now were thought to be impossible.
For example, flying and other things, like listening to music from thousands of miles away in the radio, would certainly have been thought impossible if people had ever imagined them.
Radio and television are no longer just inventions that bring pleasure and amusement to our homes.
By means of radio and television we can do an endless number of jobs: call doctors to far-off places in the Arctic, help airplanes to land automatically in bad weather, direct the work of a dozen machines at once, or guide the flight of rockets and sputniks in space.
